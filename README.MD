# RSN Name Change Bot

Because it's been requested multiple times and Grams doesn't mind, I have created a public source code for the name-change part we enforce within Star Miners discord.

## How to use
1. Clone or download this repository
2. run `npm install`
3. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`
4. Get yourself a discord bot token here: https://discord.com/developers/applications. MAKE SURE TO ENABLE "MESSAGE CONTENT" PRIVILEGED GATEWAY
5. Fill in the fields in `config.json`
6. run `npm start` to run the bot.

## I DonT knoW TypEsCript
Learn it! it's a great addition to javascript.  
You can run `npx tsc` to convert the typescript code to javascript code.

## Support
